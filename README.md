## Assignment 01
This Java program accepts a student’s name, roll number, and marks for five subjects, then calculates the average percentage. Based on the percentage, it assigns and displays the grade (A, B, or C). The program demonstrates basic OOP concepts such as classes, constructors, methods, and access specifiers.

## Assignment 02
This Java program demonstrates hierarchical inheritance using a base class Employee and derived classes FullTimeEmployee and InternEmployee. The program calculates salary increments (50% hike for full-time employees and 25% hike for interns) and displays the salary before and after the hike. It illustrates the use of inheritance, method overriding, and constructors in Java.
